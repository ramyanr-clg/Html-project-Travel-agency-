A clg project to create a Travel agency site  

HTML PROJECT: Travel Agency Landing Page
NAME: RAMYAN R
DEPARTMENT: AIDS (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science)
YEAR: 2026-2027
Introduction
First, I would like to express my gratitude for this wonderful opportunity to design a webpage independently. My project focuses on creating a modern Travel Agency website using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Project Structure & Design
•	Navigation: The landing page features a sleek, sticky navigation bar in sky blue with fluid hover states for easy accessibility.
•	Hero Section: This section commands attention with a high-definition landscape background and a tagline that fades and zooms into view upon page entry.
•	Responsiveness: The layout is fully responsive, utilizing a Tailwind grid system that seamlessly transitions from a multi-column desktop view to a stacked layout for mobile users.
Featured Destinations
The "Destinations" gallery showcases locations such as the Maldives and Iceland using rounded, shadowed cards. Each card features a hover-lift animation, creating a tactile and interactive feel. Short, evocative descriptions sit beneath vibrant imagery to spark immediate travel interest.
Packages & Services
A dedicated "Packages" section presents Basic, Premium, and Luxury tiers in clean pricing tables. The Premium tier is visually prioritized as the "Best Value," featuring a bold orange accent and a slightly larger scale. Every table includes a smooth border-color transition on hover and a prominent, Tailwind-styled "Book Now" button.
Footer
The page concludes with a professional, dark-themed footer containing essential contact details and social media connectivity, ensuring a polished end-to-end user experience.
